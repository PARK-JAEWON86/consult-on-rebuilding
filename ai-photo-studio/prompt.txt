Transform the uploaded selfie into a hyper-realistic, high-quality professional studio headshot. Maintain the subject's unique facial features and expression from the original image. The subject should be wearing a business formal attire (e.g., a fitted blazer and collared shirt). Employ professional studio strobe lighting with a large octabox as the key light and a fill light for subtle shadow reduction, ensuring soft and even illumination. The background must be a neutral, soft-focus studio backdrop (such as a smooth light gray or subtle gradient). The pose should be a head-and-shoulders close-up, with a confident and approachable expression and direct eye contact. Shot on a Canon EOS R5 with an 85mm f/1.4 lens. Output in 8K resolution, with crisp focus on the face.
